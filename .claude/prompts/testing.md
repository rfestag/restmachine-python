Whenever you implement a new feature, you should use a test driven development (TDD) approach.
Start with adding a new tests (or small set of tests as appropriate) that demonstrate the intended effect.
Whenever possible, leverage the DSL. Then, run the tests to verify they fail. Finally, provide an initial, minimal implementation
that causes the test to pass. Once it passes, please refactor and simplify as appropriate.
